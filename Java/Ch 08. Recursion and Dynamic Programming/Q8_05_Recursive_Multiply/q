Recursive Multiply: Write a recursive function to multiply two positive integers without using
the * operator (or / operator). You can use addition, subtraction, and bit shifting, but you should
minimize the number of those operations.


Solution ::
We can think about multiplying 8x7 as doing 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 (or adding 7 eight times). We can also think
about it as the number of squares in an 8x7 grid.
