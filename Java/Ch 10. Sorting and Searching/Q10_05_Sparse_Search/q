If it weren't for the empty strings, we could simply use binary search. We would compare the string to be
found, s tr, with the midpoint of the array, and go from there.
With empty strings interspersed, we can implement a simple modification of binary search. All we need to
do is fix the comparison against mid, in case mid is an empty string. We simply move mid to the closest
non-empty string.
The recursive code below to solve this problem can easily be modified to be iterative. We provide such an
implementation in the code attachment.
