-`Def:
  Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. 
  Composite lets client treat individual objects and composition of objects uniformly.
  This pattern structures of objects in form of trees that contain both compositions of objects 
  and individual objects as nodes. Using composite structures,we can apply same operations over 
  both composite and individual objects. in other words,in most cases we can ignore differences 
  between composition of objects and individual objects.
