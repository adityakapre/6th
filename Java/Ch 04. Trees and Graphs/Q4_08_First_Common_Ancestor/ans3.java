Solution #3: Without Links to Parents
Alternatively, you could follow a chain in which p and q are on the same side. That is, if p and q are both on
the left of the node, branch left to look for the common ancestor. If they are both on the right, branch right
to look for the common ancestor. When p and q are no longer on the same side, you must have found the
first common ancestor.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time on a balanced tree. This is because covers is called on 2n nodes in the
first call (n nodes for the left side, and n nodes for the right side). After that the algorithm branches left or
right, at which point covers will be called on 2n/2 nodes, then 2n/4, and so on. This results in a runtime
of O(n).
We know at this point that we cannot do better than that in terms of the asymptotic runtime since we need
to potentially look at every node in the tree. However, we may be able to improve it by a constant multiple.
