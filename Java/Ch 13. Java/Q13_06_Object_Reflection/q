13.6 Object Reflection: Explain what object reflection is in Java and why it is useful.

SOLUTION
---------
Object Reflection is a feature in Java that provides a way to get reflective information about Java classes and
objects, and perform operations such as:
1. Getting information about the methods and fields present inside the class at runtime.
2. Creating a new instance of a class.
3. Getting and setting the object fields directly by getting field reference, regardless of what the access
modifier is.

Why Is Object Reflection Useful?
Of course, it doesn't seem very useful in the above example, but reflection can be very useful in some cases.
Three main reasons are:
1. It can help you observe or manipulate the runtime behavior of applications.
2. It can help you debug or test programs, as you have direct access to methods, constructors, and fields.
3. You can call methods by name when you don't know the method in advance. For example, we may let
the user pass in a class name, parameters for the constructor, and a method name. We can then use this
information to create an object and call a method. Doing these operations without reflection would
require a complex series of if-statements, if it's possible at all.
