1.  For strings, s.charAt(i) returns character at ith location in string but when
    its casted as integer or used as array index e.g arr[s.charAt(i)], it gets
    converted to ascii value of the character.
2.  The basic ASCII set uses 7 bits for each character, giving it a total of 128 unique symbols. 
    The extended ASCII character set uses 8 bits, which gives it an additional 128 characters. 
    The extra characters represent characters from foreign languages and special symbols 
    for drawing pictures.
3.  i==mid+1 is the condition for string to be palindrome
4.  Water trapped on ith location: water += Math.min(leftMax[i],rightMax[i]) - arr[i];
